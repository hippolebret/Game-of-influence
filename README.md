Project Proposal
Title : Game of influence 
Introduction:
The field of data science and machine learning offers numerous opportunities to apply advanced techniques to real-world problems. In the context of this project, we aim to explore and analyze the underlying motivations of the influence exerted by online influencers. Our objective is to understand why some individuals are influenced by the actions and recommendations of an influencer while seeking ways to mitigate this influence based on an individual's profile.

Problem Statement:
Our central problem statement is as follows: "What are the driving forces that lead individuals to be influenced by online influencers, and how can we, based on their profile, reduce this influence?"

Motivation:
The main reason why we have chosen this topic is because of a French rapper, Booba, who has decided to fight against influencers who advertise lots of fake and scams products. We also have chosen this question due to the increasing prevalence of social media and online influencers in our contemporary society. Understanding why certain people are influenced by these figures is essential for more effectively targeting and personalizing influencer marketing campaigns.


Objectives:
-	Understand the psychological, social, and economic factors underlying the influence exerted by online influencers.
-	 Identify different categories of individual profiles based on their receptivity to influence.
-	Propose strategies to reduce influence for each identified profile category

Methodology:
Our methodology is based on a holistic approach to deeply understand the mechanisms underlying the influence exerted by online influencers and how it varies according to individual profiles. We will begin with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique that will allow us to highlight the most significant textual dimensions related to the exerted influence. The extracted principal components will assist us in identifying the key motivational and receptivity factors.

In addition, we will employ the Monte Carlo method to simulate complex scenarios. This approach will enable us to model and simulate the public's reactions to various types of influencer content. By varying the parameters, we can explore different situations contributing to influence. This will help us better comprehend how individuals can be affected by various factors, such as content tone, influencer's popularity, and other variables.
A crucial aspect of our methodology is the application of clustering techniques. We will group similar individual profiles based on their receptivity to influence. By identifying homogeneous groups, we can gain a deeper understanding of trends and distinctions between these groups. It will also allow us to target specific recommendations for each profile category.
Regression analysis will serve as another essential tool in our methodology. Using regression models, we will assess the relationships between different variables, including audience characteristics and levels of influence. This will help us identify the most significant factors influencing influence and quantify their impact.
As needed, we may explore additional methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to model complex behaviors. Our approach prioritizes in-depth understanding over simplistic predictive models.
In conclusion, our methodology combines dimensionality reduction, simulation, clustering, regression, and statistical learning techniques to comprehensively address our problem statement. We are confident that this approach will enable us to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms behind online influencer influence and provide specific recommendations for mitigating this influence based on individual profiles.
